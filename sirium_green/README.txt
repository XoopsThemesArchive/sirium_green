This theme was created from a design from Jaco at I.T. Lighthouse, by
sirium.net.

You can use this theme freely, but there are some restrictions, please 
see the file "License.txt" for more information.


Installation:
=============

Upload the theme's folder (usually named "sirium_<something>") into the 
folder named "themes" XOOPS installation root.

Go to the "site preferences" in XOOPS admin, and "general preferences";
from here, you can either select as the default theme and/or as one of
the selectable themes (hold down the Ctrl key to select more than one 
theme).


Logo information:
=================

Obviously, the logo won't be suitable for your site, but is included as
an example. The current size is 244 by 62 pixels, this will have to be 
changed in the theme.html file if you have a logo of a different size.

The included logo uses the "Justinian" font for the main logo text, and
"Justinian 2" for the slogan text.
